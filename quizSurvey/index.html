        <span class="span_start">Scenario:</span> Repairing ID scanners has become too costly. You are being trained to watch the camera and see who is supposed to be there. Due to privacy concerns, you will only see black and white sillhouettes of people trying to get in. 
      </p>
      <p class="p_class">
        <span class="span_start">Instructions:</span> The training will be split into two phases; learning and identification. During the Learning phase, you will be shown 9 recordings of authorized personnel. Some will be holding bags, others will have coats on, and others will have neither.
      </p>
      <p class="p_class"> Once you feel confident you can identify them, you may start the  Identification phase. During this phase, you will be shown 10 recordings of persons walking, and asked to identify them as authorized or unauthorized.
